# Setting up exim-relay

This is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) role which installs the [Exim](https://www.exim.org/) mailer via [exim-relay](https://github.com/devture/exim-relay) to run as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container wrapped in a systemd service.

## Prerequisites

To use exim-relay, make sure you have configured the firewall properly. You'll probably need to allow outgoing traffic for TCP ports 25/587 (depending on configuration) on your server if you have not.

## Adjusting the playbook configuration

To enable exim-relay with this role, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file.

**Notes**:
- The path should be something like `inventory/host_vars/mash.example.com/vars.yml` if you use the [MASH (Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting)](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook) Ansible playbook.
- If you use the MDAD (matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) playbook, you do not need to enable exim-relay as it is enabled by default. See its [`matrix_servers`](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/group_vars/matrix_servers) for details.

### Enable DKIM support (optional)

By default, exim-relay attempts to deliver emails directly. This may or may not work, depending on your domain configuration.

To improve email deliverability, you can set up *DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)* authentication method, along with SPF and DMARC. Without setting either of them, your outgoing email is most likely to be quarantined as spam at recipient's mail servers.

Exim-relay supports DKIM. With DKIM enabled, exim-relay adds cryptographically signed digital signatures to outgoing emails' headers using the sender's private key.

To enable DKIM support, at first you need to create a DKIM key pair. You can use DKIM with RSA signatures and Ed25519 elliptic curve signatures. For details about enabling Ed25519 signatures (characteristics, how to create an Ed25519 key pair, etc.), you can refer an article such as [this one](https://www.mailhardener.com/kb/how-to-use-dkim-with-ed25519).

#### Add the public key

After creating a key pair, add its **public key** to your domain's DKIM DNS record. Look on the internet for a guide about how to do so.

Note that every DKIM record must have a unique identifier called as "selector". On exim-relay the default value is set to `default`, and your DKIM record's DNS name will be `default._domainkey.example.com`.

You can edit the selector by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
exim_relay_dkim_selector: exampleselector
```

With this configuration, your DKIM record's DNS name would be `exampleselector._domainkey.example.com`.

#### Add the private key

Then, add your DKIM's **private key** by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file. Running the installation command of your playbook will create a private key file with it (`dkim.private` by default) on your server, which exim-relay will use to sign outgoing emails.

```yaml
exim_relay_dkim_privkey_contents: |
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  â€¦
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

**Note**: the whole key (all of its belonging lines) under the variable needs to be indented with 2 spaces.

> [!WARNING]
> DKIM support cannot be activated when it is enabled to relay email through another SMTP server.

### Relaying email through another SMTP server (optional)

**On some cloud providers such as Google Cloud, [port 25 is always blocked](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/sending-mail/), so sending email directly from your server is not possible.** In this case, you will need to relay email through another SMTP server by adding the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
exim_relay_sender_address: "another.sender@example.com"
exim_relay_relay_use: true
exim_relay_relay_host_name: "mail.example.com"
exim_relay_relay_host_port: 587
exim_relay_relay_auth: true
exim_relay_relay_auth_username: "another.sender@example.com"
exim_relay_relay_auth_password: "PASSWORD_FOR_THE_RELAY_HERE"
```

**Note**: only the secure submission protocol (using `STARTTLS`, usually on port `587`) is supported. **SMTPS** (encrypted SMTP, usually on port `465`) **is not supported**.

#### Sending emails using Sendgrid

An easy and free SMTP service to set up is [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/). Its free tier allows for up to 100 emails per day to be sent.

To set it up, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file (adapt to your needs):

```yaml
exim_relay_sender_address: "example@example.org"
exim_relay_relay_use: true
exim_relay_relay_host_name: "smtp.sendgrid.net"
exim_relay_relay_host_port: 587
exim_relay_relay_auth: true

# This needs to be literally the string "apikey". It is always the same for Sendgrid.
exim_relay_relay_auth_username: "apikey"

# You can generate the API key password at this URL: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
# The password looks something like `SG.955oW1mLSfwds7i9Yd6IA5Q.q8GTaB8q9kGDzasegdG6u95fQ-6zkdwrPP8bOeuI`.
exim_relay_relay_auth_password: "YOUR_API_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

## Installing

After configuring the playbook, run the installation command of your playbook as below:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts setup.yml --tags=setup-all,start
```

If you use the MASH or MDAD Ansible playbook, the shortcut commands with the [`just` program](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/just.md) are also available: `just install-all` or `just setup-all`

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with email not being delivered, it may be useful to inspect the mailer logs.

To do so, log in to the server with SSH and run `journalctl -fu exim-relay` (or how you/your playbook named the service, e.g. `mash-exim-relay`, `matrix-exim-relay`).
